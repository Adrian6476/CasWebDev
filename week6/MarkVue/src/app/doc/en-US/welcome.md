## This is a latex formula
$$
\mathcal{L}(a, p, n) = \max \left( d(a, p) - d(a, n) + \alpha, 0 \right)
$$

## This is a python snippet
```python
def triplet_loss(margin=1.0):
    def loss(y_true, y_pred):
        anchor, positive, negative = y_pred[0], y_pred[1], y_pred[2]
        pos_dist = tf.reduce_sum(tf.square(anchor - positive), axis=1)
        neg_dist = tf.reduce_sum(tf.square(anchor - negative), axis=1)
        loss_value = tf.maximum(pos_dist - neg_dist + margin, 0.0)
        return tf.reduce_mean(loss_value)
    return loss
```
